# Project-Bank-Application

Our project will be creating a bank app that consists of four main classes. These are 1) a share class for shares in OMXS30, 2) a loaning class for loaning money, 3) a bank class for creating banks, and 4) an account class that will consist of all accounts in the bank.
More specifically:

**Share Class (OMXS30):** The Share Class will handle the representation of individual stocks within the OMXS30 index, which consists of the 30 most traded stocks on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Each share object will store relevant information such as the stock's name, latest price, opening price, closing price, trading volume, and percentage change. This class will provide methods for accessing and updating this information, allowing users to track and manage their stock investments.

**Loaning Class:** The Loaning Class will handle loan-related operations within the bank app. It will store information about each loan, such as the loan amount, interest rate, outstanding balance, and credit limit. This class will provide methods for applying for loans, approving loans, repaying loans, and updating interest rates. By implementing this class, users can apply for loans, manage their outstanding balances, and monitor their interest payments.

**Bank Class:** The Bank Class will be responsible for creating and managing bank objects. Each bank object will store information about the bank, such as its name and address. The class will provide methods for adding and removing accounts, loans, and shares, as well as for performing other bank-related operations. With this class, it will facilitate the creation and management of multiple banks, each with its own set of accounts.

**Account Class:** The Account Class will represent individual bank accounts within the app. Each account object will store information about the account holder, account number, balance, and other relevant details. The class will provide methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as for transferring funds between accounts. By implementing the Account Class, the app will allow users to manage their finances by keeping track of their account balances, transactions, and other banking activities.

4. Scan the QR-code in your terminal with your mobile device
5. The app should open and you can navigate in it.
6. If you want to be able to use the app at all times without having to activate expo through the terminal, publish the app to expo
