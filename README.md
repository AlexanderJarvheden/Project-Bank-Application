Our project consisted of showing the knowledge aquired through our first year in Computer Science and Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and developing a project of our own choice. We decided to test our limits and learn many new things including the use of frameworks, React Native, JavaScript and Expo. We learnt a lot and developed a prototype of what could work as a Bank application - CeriseBank.

Main features in the application are:
- Create new users and sign in. When signed in, a sign out tab shows at the top right of the header.
- Create new accounts with unique account numbers and account types (checkings, savings etc)
- Transfer money from different accounts (only possible between a user's own accounts and not between two users)
- A stock plattform where you can check the latest prices on stocks in the S&P 500 and buy a wished amount with fictional money. You can also see your portfolio with stocks and sell them if you want.
- A loan plattform where it was supposed to calculate the interest based on the balance of the user to assess its risk in comparision with the loan amount. The user can enter the wished amount of the loan and the interest is calculated, then the payback can be done on the same page. This feature did sadly not get developed in time and does thus crash the program.


Requirements in order to use the app are as follwing:
1. Make sure you have expo installed through your terminal
2. Install the expo-go app on your mobile device
3. To run the application start expo in your terminal when you are inside the project, e.g type "expo start"
4. Scan the QR-code in your terminal with your mobile device
5. The app should open and you can navigate in it.
6. If you want to be able to use the app at all times without having to activate expo through the terminal, publish the app to expo
7. Now you can run the project on your device whenever you want, and it does not require your computer/laptop to be powered on
